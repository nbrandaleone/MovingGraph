This project is a starting point for using an iPhone/iPad to collect
data from an Arduino sensor.

I have shown how to create a moving graphical display, using random data generated once per second.

TO DO
=====
1) I need to add Auto Layout, to handle different devices and rotations.
2) A start/stop button for data collection.
3) A way to save/send data to external device or person
4) Use touch to get detail on data. Perhaps actual points in table view.
5) Use pinch/zoom to look at section with greater detail
6) A way to alter time window. Currently defaults to 20 s. Perhaps a slider?
